# Wiringbits Handbook
This document describes how we work at Wiringbits, including technical and non-technical details.

You should be reading this if:

1. You are interested or considering to join us.
2. You are a new team member.
3. You are team member wondering what to do in your current situation.


**Disclaimer**: Work in progress.


## Hardware

You can either use your own computer or one from Wiringbits, it is important that you work by using full disk encryption.

## Security
Your work computer must use Full Disk Encryption, this is applied to all Wiringbits computers but you are expected to handle that if you use your own computer.

https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault for managing AWS keys locally.

Secrets are handled by https://wiringbits.1password.com/home, all members must have an account.

When getting to work in a new project (or with a new customer), you are expected to create an isolated Chrome profile just for this, it is crucial that such a profile does not have any browser extension installed. All applications related to the project must be accessed through this profile.

## Professional communication is required

At Wiringbits trust is a privilege, one constantly earned and validated, we are committed to our compromises, and we're responsible to minimize the possibility of any scenario where deadlines are not meet or expected quality is not accomplished, any team compromising situation requires mandatory communication as soon a possible, your team expects transparency and anything different will not be tolerated, keep in mind that effective communication increases the chances of success.

You are require to always behave professionally, excellent communication is key to succeed at Wiringbits.

This means, most of the time, it is preferred to over-communicate.

At Wiringbits, we don't have any fixed schedule, which has its own challenges while working with others.

There are some examples of the expected behavior:

1. It must be clear to the team whether you are available or not, given that Discord is our main chat, switch your status to offine when you are not able to reply.
2. When you can't work for any reason, it must be communicated as soon as possible to Wiringbits and to the customer you are working with (if any).
3. You will usually have expected deliverables, when you notice that you won't be able to deliver, it must be communicated as soon as possible, this way, we can try finding a workaround.
4. There could be situations when get involved with a project/customer but you don't feel to be a good fit, this situation must be communicated ASAP. Having this information, we can work on finding a solution (most likely, switching you to another project). Staying busy in a situation like this is counterproductive, it prevent us from giving a good service to the our customer, and, it can also lead us to not take potential projects because we don't have any availability.

These are unacceptable behavior examples:

1. I haven't worked much this week because I'm having personal issues, still, I let my team discover it when I failed to deliver instead of communicated it accordingly. Wiringbits is as transparent as possible, we expect the same from its members.
2. I couldn't work much this week, still, I did not communicate it, I neither ask for time off because I have already planned how to use my vacations. Wiringbits is super flexible, there is likely a way to resolve this situation but we can't do anything if you don't communicate it.


## Work prioritization

In the projects from our customers, the priorities will be defined by them.

In our projects, bugs are always more important that any new development.

Be sure to communicate with your team before taking an exception to these cases.
